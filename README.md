# Talent-acq-using-MEAN
A multifunctional Angular project which can be used to search relevant profiles from a db of profiles.
Built on Mean Stack.

Project Scope :-

1. Admin Access :- Only the admin can provide access to a user on the application, admin can modify the email template which may contain some pre defined context variables, which will be replaced accordingly before the mail is sent.

2. User Access :- The User will only have a single screen after login, in which he will not be able to do any data changes, only read option is available.


Key Highlights :-

1. UI is completely made out of MaterialUI.
2. The MAT-Table's columns are changed once someone tries to perform an advance search.
3. Login and session maintenance is just done via local storage and vanilla  IF_ELSE as I had no prior knowledge of Passport or authguard,    but will implement that soon
