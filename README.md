# Talent-acq-using-MEAN
A multifunctional Angular project which can be used to search relevant profiles from a db of profiles.
Built on Mean Stack.

Key Highlights :-

1. UI is completely made out of MaterialUI.
2. The MAT-Table's columns are changed once someone tries to perform an advance search.
3. Login and session maintenance is just done via local storage and vanilla  IF_ELSE as I had no prior knowledge of Passport or authguard,    but will implement that soon
